"""Utility functions for applying a band‑pass filter to one‑dimensional signals.

The functions in this module leverage SciPy's digital filter design
and filtering capabilities to isolate the frequency band associated
with the human pulse. A typical heart rate falls between roughly
0.75 Hz (45 beats per minute) and 4 Hz (240 beats per minute). When
processing remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals it is common
to apply a band‑pass filter to remove low‑frequency drift and
high‑frequency noise.

Example usage:

    from utils.bandpass_filter import bandpass_filter
    filtered = bandpass_filter(signal, fs=30, low=0.75, high=4.0)

    Parameters
    ----------
    signal : np.ndarray
        One‑dimensional array containing the raw rPPG signal.
    fs : float
        Sampling frequency of the signal in Hertz. This should
        correspond to the frame rate of the video from which the
        signal was extracted.
    low : float, optional
        Lower cutoff frequency in Hertz. Defaults to 0.75 Hz.
    high : float, optional
        Upper cutoff frequency in Hertz. Defaults to 4.0 Hz.
    order : int, optional
        Order of the Butterworth filter. Higher orders have
        steeper roll‑off but may introduce more phase distortion.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        Filtered signal with the same shape as the input.
